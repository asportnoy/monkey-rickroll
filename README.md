# Monkey Rick roll
If you put a monkey in front of a keyboard for long enough, will it eventually write the lyrics to "Never gonna give you up" by Rick Astley?

Only alphabetic characters (case insensitive) and spaces are included. So each character has 27 possibilities.  
To spawn more "monkeys" (threads), use the `THREADS` environment variable.
## Purpose
I wanted to do something in Rust and I was bored. That's it.
